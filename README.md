# ApiChecker Documentation
Welcome to the ApiChecker API documentation ðŸ‘‹
Below you will able to find quick summary of open API for ApiChecker

# API Server URL / Playground
Currently API server located at this URL: [https://api.apichecker.com/graph/](https://api.apichecker.com/graph/)
We also have setup Playground editor for ApiChecker - so you can explore it using real data (from your account).
Also on this URL you will able to find the GraphQL Playground.

# Get Started
You are invited to get started using ApiChecker. You may explore ApiChecker by:

* GraphQL ApiChecker API (primary way)
* Regular REST API
 
To start using our API you need create new API Token / Access token from your account.
To create Access Token follow below steps: 
* Open your account setting on APiChecker Dashboard: [Dashboard](https://app.apichecker.com/account/settings/api), 
* Enter your Access Token name
* Click to "Generate button"
* Copy and secure store token from field that will be showed below the button.

!> Please copy access token and store it in secure storage - you will not able to get it from dashboard later


## Access Token Header

Access token should be passed as part of every HTTP request to our API. 
Header example:
```text
api_key: $2axxxxxxx5qwg8ARwH5IMxnpR8X6Ko.P6x6dxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx123123
```

## Code examples

### HTTP request via regular REST API (nodejs):
```js
const request = require('request');
const serverUrl = "https://api.apichecker.com/graph/";
const accessToken = "xxxx10$c8onxxxxx8F60hf4Wox6i.dZNyuknIxxxxxC4lJ.cJEm2Efxxxxxx8pu";
const options = {
    url: serverUrl + "?query={me{name}}",
    headers: { 'api_key': accessToken }
};
request(options, (err, response, body) => {
    console.log(body);
    /*
    Will print: 
    {"data":{"me":{"name":"User Name"}}}
    * */
})
```

### HTTP request using GraphQL client:
And below example using graphql client `apollo-boost`.
This example retrieve list of Applications and their monitors via GraphQL query:

```js
require('cross-fetch/polyfill')
const gql = require('graphql-tag')
const Client = require('apollo-boost')

const client = new Client.default({
    uri: "http://localhost:3500/graph/",
    request: async operation => {
        operation.setContext({
            headers: {
                api_key: "ACCESS_TOKEN" ///set your access TOKEN
            }
        });
    },
})

client.query({  ///your query - you can generate it via Playgroud (you can find it in above url) as well.
    query:  gql`query {
        apps {
            appName,
            monitors {
                monitorUrl
                authRequired,
                checkInterval,
                uptime {
                    avgHealthLastDay,
                },
                currentStatus,
                sslInformation {
                    valid
                }
                lastCheck {
                    elapsedTime
                }
            }
        }
    }`})
.then(result => console.log(result.data));
```

And as result you will only get information that you request/need:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "apps": [
      {
        "appName": "ApiChecker",
        "monitors": [
          {
            "monitorUrl": "https://apichecker.com/",
            "authRequired": false,
            "checkInterval": 180,
            "uptime": {
              "avgHealthLastDay": 100
            },
            "currentStatus": "UP",
            "sslInformation": {
              "valid": true
            },
            "lastCheck": {
              "elapsedTime": 680
            }
          },
          {
            "monitorUrl": "https://app.apichecker.com/",
            "authRequired": false,
            "checkInterval": 180,
            "uptime": {
              "avgHealthLastDay": 100
            },
            "currentStatus": "UP",
            "sslInformation": {
              "valid": true
            },
            "lastCheck": {
              "elapsedTime": 380
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

# Pause uptime monitoring during deployment

You probably will want to pause monitoring during releases or deployments.
We have API for pause/resume API - it's also served by GraphQL:

```graphql
mutation {
    changeMonitorStatus(monitorId: "{yourMonitorID}", enable: true, delay:20000)
}
```

Where: 
* `monitorId` is your monitorID that you want to pause
* `enable` - true is you want to resume Monitoring, false if you want to pause it
* `delay` - count of milliseconds that ApiChecker should wait until request will take effect (change monitoring status)  

So in below example we will enable monitoring after 20000 milliseconds (one deploy will be completed totally). 

If you want to call it via normal/regular HTTP url, just you below request url:

```http
https://api.apichecker/graph/?mutation={changeMonitorStatus(monitorId:"5c90908f147dfd00105961f3",enable:false,delay:20000)}
```

Or similar analog with POST request to /graph/ endpoint, where body will be QUERY.
